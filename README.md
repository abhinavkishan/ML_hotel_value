Training ML models to predict the market value of hotel properties is essentially a regression problem, where the target variable is the HotelValue. Several factors, as mentioned below, contribute to estimating a property's value, making this task a matter of learning the quantitative relationship between property characteristics and their corresponding market prices. These factors include location, land size, architectural design, overall condition, year of construction, renovation history, and available facilities such as pools, lounges, and parking spaces.
